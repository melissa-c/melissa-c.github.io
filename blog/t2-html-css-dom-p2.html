        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>

        <p>
        Grid based design is where a design is laid out according to a grid of columns and rows. This grid helps to create visual order by way of well aligned elements on the screen, balanced spacing between elements, and a visual hierarchy.
        </p>

        
        <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>

        <p>
        The "on the go" nature of people's lives and the increasingly rapid release of new gadgetry create an ever-growing demand for companies and websites to evolve or be left behind. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Responsive webpages cater to the diverse screen sizes of the multitude of devices that proliferate the modern world. The responsive changes aim to make aesthetic improvements across multiple screen sizes, but also aim to improve the functionality of the webpage. For example, making the interactive buttons larger so they're easier to press with thumbs on a small mobile phone screen.
        </p>

        <h3>Semantic structure</h3>

        <p>
        Similar to the "measure twice, cut once" approach, having a well thought out hierarchy of logical and consistent labels for the structure of content/code is important as it makes it easier to decifer later on when changes/updates may be required or if another developer needs to work on the same project.
        </p> 

        <p>
        For instance, if the headings in your text that signify a new section of content are the most important structurally they would be assigned the heading tag of h1, the second most important headings would be assigned h2, and so forth.
        </p> 

        <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</h3>

        <p>
        I like seeing how people find creative ways of fitting the same content onto different sized screens while still making the design clean, visually make sense, and have a good flow. The "hamburger" menu icon being a good example.
