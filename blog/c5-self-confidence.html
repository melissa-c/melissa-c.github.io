            <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
             
            <p><em>C5: 27th Jan 2016</em></p>
             
            <h4>Search Inside Yourself: Chapter 4</h4>
            
            <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>

            <p>
              Theyâ€™re essentially the same thing and both relate to emotional intelligence. Self awareness is the ability to recognise and understand our own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, etc and their effects on our behaviour. Mindfulness is paying attention deliberately to the moment without judgment and objectively. So they have quite a symbiotic relationship.
            </p>

            <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>

            <p>
              While I have a habit of regularly doing similar practices that mimic Body Scan and Journaling, I had not practised them with the same level of focus before. So while they were not new to me as such, the depth at which I experienced them was new. After the Body Scan I felt relaxed and had less tension in my shoulders and lower back. After the journaling it felt like a purge of frustration from the work this week.
            </p>


            <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h3>

            <p>
              Too often people, myself included, react to experiences in a way that is more knee-jerk and that can often feel like those emotions are out of their control. So when the perspective of emotions and their origins are changed, they become more controllable and the person can hone those skills rather than beat themselves up because they think their personality or identity is defined by their emotions.
