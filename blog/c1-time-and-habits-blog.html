    <h1>Time and Habit Techniques</h1>
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    
    <p>
     As I've only just read about the different techniques, I haven't tried many yet. I did the timebox technique of an hour and that was a good amount of time to focus without getting out of a rhythm. I also try to get up, do stretches and clear my mind for a few minutes regularly. But I can get caught up in being in "the zone" and forget to take more regular breaks.

     The tiny habits and creating habits techniques sounded realistic, logical, and achieveable. So I will definitely try the chocolate reward system ;)

     Getting up regularly works for me. Though sometimes I lose track of time so I will incorporate some of the Pomodoro technique by setting a timer to be more strict with the time and hopefully strengthen the time it takes to focus.

     I will experiment more with the tiny habits and timeboxing. They seem to be a good fit for my working/learning style.
