          <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>

          <p>
           HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and DOM (Document Object Model) work together to display a website. 
          </p>

          <p>
           Building a website is like building a model toy car where the HTML is the content or the car parts, the CSS is the style or the way the car looks, and the DOM is the tree-like representation of the structure or the details of how the car fits together. 
          </p>

          <p>
           So the HTML will tell you what car parts you have such as wheels, doors, seats, etc, and on a website it would be the text, images, navigation menu, etc. The CSS will tell you what colour is the car, what are the size of the doors, etc and on a website it would be the font used, the placement of menus, the colour of the background, etc.</p>

           <p>
           The DOM shows you how the car fits together such as the seats are found inside the body of the vehicle, the seat belts are attached to the seats, the seat belt buckles are attached to the seat belts, etc. For a website, the DOM shows the structure of the HTML in a tree-like way so you can see what elements "branch off" other elements.
          </p>

          <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>

          <p>
           To boxify a design is to simplify and divide a design into its individual and grouped components. Each individual component (eg: an image) is represented as a box and each group of components (eg: an image with a caption) is a bigger box that houses the individual boxes. So essentially, every part of a design can be housed in a box. 
          </p>

          <h3>What is the box model?</h3>

          <p>
           The box model describes how any element on a screen is essentially a box (regardless of the shape of the element), distinguishes between the various surrounding areas around the element, and their properties. See diagram showing the different areas of the box model below.
