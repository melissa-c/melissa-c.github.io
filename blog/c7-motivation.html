            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            <p><em>C7: 8th Feb 2016</em></p>
             
            <h4>Search Inside Yourself: Chapter 6</h4>

            <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>

            <p>
              To pursue a life with a higher purpose and passion sustains happiness much longer than pursuing happiness through temporary pleasures such as external rewards. This is because passion and a higher purpose requires you to be more engaged with acquiring happiness and will have more meaning to you - especially if the happiness is derived from something altruistic or larger than ourselves.<br>
              As I get older, the pursuit of happiness through finding a higher purpose is playing a larger role. It can be difficult when you don’t feel like you know what you want or when your financial, geographical, etc situation may prevent or delay these pursuits. 
            </p>

            <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</h3>

            <h4>What are your core values?</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Compassion:</strong> being empathetic and behaving in a kind and respectful way to living things and the environment.<br>
              <strong>Justice:</strong> upholding and fighting for equality and fairness.<br>
              <strong>Truth:</strong> seeking it out and being held to account if it wanes.<br>
              <strong>Creativity:</strong> injecting a bit of fun, humour, and a different perspective on things. Giving life to things that didn’t exist before. Transforming ideas into reality. Letting the inner child play.            
            </p>

            <h4>What do you stand for?</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>Human and animal rights:</strong> supporting and speaking out for civil rights; gender equality; the humane treatment of animals; the right to live in a safe environment and have access to education, sanitation, clean water and food, healthcare, etc.<br>
              <strong>Sustainability:</strong> supporting, encouraging, and living in an environmentally-conscious way.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>

            <p>
              The resilience ideas make sense and seem like a logical way to overcome challenges. It’s helpful having these mental tools for handling emotions and failures in a more objective way. The meditation exercise was useful and made me reflect on how I personalise failure and can get frustrated. Time, hindsight, and analysis can put those feelings into perspective but I need more practise in resilience and mindfulness for when the events are happening in real time.
            </p>

            <h3>Any other musings?</h3>

            <p>
              The story about Roz Savage writing two versions of her own obituary hit home for me. The courage she had to pursue something that I would find terrifying was also really inspirational.
