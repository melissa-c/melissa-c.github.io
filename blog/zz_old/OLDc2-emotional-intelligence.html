        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>

        <p>
        I found the idea of having space/time between the stimulus and the response - and to consciously exercise this mindful state in order to strengthen and hone it - was insightful and helpful. I appreciated the scientific perspective and approach to emotional intelligence and mindfulness as I tend to be quite skeptical of people who I think are spouting woo woo.

        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>

        <p>
        It was peaceful and calming. My mind did wander occasionally and often external noises were distracting but I just tried to let those things go and focus on my breathing. Afterwards my heart rate seemed slower than when I started.
