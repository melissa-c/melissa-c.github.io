    <h1>Shereef Fireside Chat Reflections</h1>
        
    <p>
     The EDA experience sounds progressive and dynamic in its approach to education and learning. Placing the onus on the student to create their individualised learning path.
    </p>
    <p>
     My impressions so far are that the EDA approach would allow students to either soar or fall to a horrible death.... depending on whether the student's learning style suits the EDA environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I find the EDA culture both appealing and terrifying. It definitely throws me out of my comfort zone but I'm trying to ride with it to get the most out of it.

      I liked Shereef's analogies and his perspective on the educational journey. My expectations haven't changed as such, but rather, become better articulated.

   <p>
      I like the freedom that comes with this kind of self-driven learning environment even though it makes me nervous and unsure of whether I'm able to find the right balance of discipline and courage it requires.
