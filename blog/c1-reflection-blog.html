      <h1>Shereef's Fireside Chat Reflections</h1>
       
      <h3>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>
       The EDA experience sounds progressive and dynamic in its approach to education and learning. Placing the onus on the student to create their individualised learning path.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>
       My impressions so far are that the EDA approach would allow students to either soar or fall to a horrible death.... depending on whether the student's learning style suits the EDA environment. 
      </p>

      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        I find the EDA culture both appealing and terrifying. It definitely throws me out of my comfort zone but I'm trying to ride with it to get the most out of it.
      </p>

      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>
        I liked Shereef's analogies and his perspective on the educational journey. My expectations haven't changed as such, but rather, become better articulated.
      </p>

      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
        I like the freedom that comes with this kind of self-driven learning environment even though it makes me nervous and unsure of whether I'm able to find the right balance of discipline and courage it requires.
