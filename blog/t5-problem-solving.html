            <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

            <p><em>T5: 27th Jan 2016</em></p>
             
            <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
            <h4>1. Got blocked on a simple problem</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What was the problem?</strong> For the racer game, I had no clue where to begin with my JavaScript file and didn’t feel like I had enough tools in my mental JS toolbox to start coding the game. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong> I first tried to nut it out using pen and paper to sketch and write notes about what I wanted to create and what kind of functionality I wanted. I moved onto pseudocode to get a very basic outline of what I thought the big steps were.<br>
              Then I googled and did some JS learning exercises and watched/read tutorials to feel more comfortable with the JS environment, syntax, conventions, etc.<br>
              I went back through the basic pseudocode multiple times to break it down into smaller and smaller steps and tried to come up with what I thought the correct order and grouping of steps would be best. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> I felt really stupid, slow and frustrated that I couldn’t even make a start on the first step. But I was also determined to create the game. I felt more comfortable with making a start after I completed some more online courses and had a better idea of what I wanted to create. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What did you learn?</strong> It helped to break down something that felt incredibly overwhelming into more manageable bite-sized chunks and typing out and thinking through the steps. Also, it helped starting off with something that I was comfortable with and new how to do (pen and paper scribbling).
            </p>

            <h4>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>What was the problem?</strong> In the racer game, the table needed to extend if the user increased the race track. Because my table had images and text in each cell, I needed to duplicate the cells rather than just adding in extra columns.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong> I googled to see how to duplicate columns and then experimented with clone and append until the table did what I wanted it to do.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> It’s always a nice feeling when you finally type in the right keywords into google and find what you’re looking for. And, of course, when something finally works it’s euphoric!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What did you learn?</strong> I learnt a bit more about the syntax and how to structure the code. Also, to try to think ahead about what potential issues the user might encounter and how to prevent / deal with those issues early.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the below problem solving techniques and processes:</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I’m confident trying the technique as I find it helps me try to break down the problem but am not so confident about whether I’m breaking down the problem properly.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Trying something:</strong> I’m quite confident to try different things through trial and error. I did get a bit wary at times not to do things like infinite loops in case it crashes the computer.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> Haven’t tried it yet. I think I’m holding off as I think I’d feel a bit silly - or that I’d enjoy it too much and spend the whole day chatting to the duck…. I often just talk myself through the problem in my head since I’m pretty much as non-tech as it gets.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I try to read through all errors to try to decipher what has gone wrong. Not always successful in deciphering though.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Console.logging:</strong> I have no qualms about using it, I just need to remember to do it more often. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Googling:</strong> Google is my go-to resource if my pseudo coding, trying things, and reading error messages have not worked. Finding tutorials or online courses have helped and any resources that dissect things to explain each bit.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> I prefer to try to find out on my own first. Only if I’ve really hit a wall do I go to slack. In a classroom environment, I’m more likely to go to peers due to proximity and being in an environment that is more conducive to social interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Similar to the answer above.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> Have tried to do this more often. Not always successful at improving my process but am more aware of what needs to be done better.
            </p>

            <h3>Explain to your non-tech friend what these functions do in your own words:</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>.map()</strong><br>
              The map method takes a group of items (an array) and performs a set of conditions (function) to each item in the array in the order that they appear, then takes the results that that process generates to form a new array. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>.filter()</strong><br>
              Similar to the map method, the filter method takes a group of items (an array) and performs a set of conditions (function) to each item in the array in the order that they appear, but then takes only the results that pass/agree with the set of conditions that process generates to form a new array. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>.reduce()</strong><br>
              The reduce method takes a group of items (an array) and performs a set of conditions (function) to each item in the array in the order that they appear as well as to the result that each previous performance has generated in order to condense into a single value. 
            </p>

            <h3>In your own words explain how recursion compares to iteration:</h3>

            <p>
              Iteration repeatedly (looping) performs a set of conditions (function) until the conditions no longer hold true.<br>
              Recursion repeatedly (looping) performs a set of conditions (function) that uses the result that each previous performance has generated as part of the next set of conditions until the conditions no longer hold true.<br>
              So more memory is required to process a recursive function because each time the set of conditions is performed, the value of the set of conditions changes and each of these different values must be remembered until the recursion has finished.
